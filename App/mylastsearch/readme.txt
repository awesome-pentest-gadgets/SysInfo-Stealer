Description
===========

MyLastSearch utility scans the cache and history files of your Web
browser, and locate all search queries that you made with the most
popular search engines (Google, Yahoo and MSN) and with popular social
networking sites (Twitter, Facebook, MySpace). The search queries that
you made are displayed in a table with the following columns: Search
Text, Search Engine, Search Time, Search Type (General, Video, Images),
Web Browser, and the search URL.
You can select one or more search queries and then copy them to the
clipboard or save them into text/html/xml file.



Versions History
================


* Version 1.62:
  o Fixed issue with Chrome Web browser: MyLastSearch loaded only 4
    data files: data_0, data_1, data_2, data_3. It seems that when the
    cache of Chrome is large enough, it starts to create more cache data
    files (data_4, data_5...) Starting from this version, MyLastSearch
    will read these additional cache data files.

* Version 1.61:
  o Fixed to work properly with the history data of Firefox 22.

* Version 1.60:
  o Added support for Internet Explorer 10. Be aware that in order to
    get accurate results for IE10, you may need to wait a few minutes
    after you exit from Internet Explorer, so the entire cache database
    will be written to the disk. Alternatively, you can log off and then
    log on again to force the writing to disk.
  o Fixed the 'Exclude the queries made by Google Instant' option to
    work properly again (there was a change in the URL format of Google)

* Version 1.58:
  o Fixed bug: In rare cases, MyLastSearch failed to read a few
    records of Internet Explorer history.
  o Added 'Auto Size Columns+Headers' option, which allows you to
    automatically resize the columns according to the row values and
    column headers.

* Version 1.57:
  o MyLastSearch now also reads the turbo subfolder located under the
    main cache folder of Opera Web browser.

* Version 1.56:
  o Fixed MyLastSearch to detect the correct cache folder of Firefox
    if the user changed it from Firefox config
    (browser.cache.disk.parent_directory).

* Version 1.55:
  o The search queries are now displayed while scanning the
    history/cache files of your Web browsers.
  o Added 'Stop' menu item displayed while scanning the Web browser
    data, which allows you to stop the scanning process.

* Version 1.50:
  o Added 'Mark Odd/Even Rows' option, under the View menu. When it's
    turned on, the odd and even rows are displayed in different color, to
    make it easier to read a single line.
  o On Windows Vista/7/2008: The cache of Internet Explorer is now
    loaded from both the base cache folder and the 'Low' subfolder. (In
    the previous versions, only one of them was loaded, according to the
    last modified date/time of the index.dat file)

* Version 1.49:
  o Fixed to work properly with the history file of Firefox 4 Beta.

* Version 1.48:
  o Fixed to work properly with the cache of Firefox 4 Beta.

* Version 1.47:
  o Fixed MyLastSearch to read the cache files of Chrome Web browser
    when it's opened and locks the files.

* Version 1.46:
  o Added 'Exclude the queries made by Google Instant' option. This
    option is turned on by default. The new 'Google Instant' feature
    generates a search query for every letter that the user type in the
    search box, and fills the search queries displayed by MyLastSearch
    with junk queries of incomplete words. This option removes all these
    junk queries.

* Version 1.45:
  o You can now send the search engine queries list to stdout by
    specifying an empty filename ("") in the command-line of all save
    parameters.
    For example: MyLastSearch.exe /stab "" >> c:\temp\queries.txt
  o Added 'Add Header Line To CSV/Tab-Delimited File' option. When
    this option is turned on, the column names are added as the first
    line when you export to csv or tab-delimited file.

* Version 1.44:
  o Fixed a problem with crash/exception when reading the cache of
    Chrome Web browser.

* Version 1.43:
  o Fixed MyLastSearch to work with Opera 10.50

* Version 1.42:
  o Added support for sorting the saved search queries list from
    command-line - /sort
  o Fixed MyLastSearch to automatically detect the cache folder of
    Opera 10.

executable file (MyLastSearch.exe) to any folder you like, and run it.
After running it, MyLastSearch scans the cache and history files of your
Web browsers (Internet Explorer and/or Firefox), and find all search
queries stored in them. The scanning process may take from a few seconds
to 1 minute, depending on the size of your cache and history files.
After the scanning process is finished, the main window should display
the list of all search queries the you made with the most popular search
engines.
